# sampling-tool
The intended use of this application was to manipulate the movement of a metal scraping tool, allowing the user to successfully withdraw a sample product from the inside of a nuclear pipe.

This project was written in Python, using <a href="https://github.com/pygame/pygame">PyGame<a/>. Though it was not an ideal library choice for this project, it is extremely user-friendly, and we had a short timeframe to complete this project. The uploaded files are solely the frontend elements of this project. <br> 

All assets were created by Talen Tsigaris and Emily Lin.
